What a great meeting! The Joint Annual Meeting ISMRM-ESMRMB took place from the 7th to the 12th of May in London, UK 🎡 

During this week participants had the chance to learn about the different MR-related research that is being done all over the world! Filled with amazing plenary talks and networking sessions, now it’s time for relaxation 🤓 and recap.

The Iberian presence in London was remarkable. Several Spanish and Portuguese researchers were able to **share their work**, either with **Posters, Oral Presentations, or Power pitches**. The ISMRM Iberian Chapter [highlighted](https://ismrm-iberian.eu/2022/04/26/ISMRMAbstracts.html) their work during the conference.
Congratulations to all, including our president Rita G. Nunes who gave an educational lecture, teaching us about ‘Parallel Imaging: How & Why it Moved So Quickly to Product’. 🧲

Of course, we didn’t miss the opportunity for a social Iberian event 😸🍻 This gathering happened at a traditional **London pub** on Sunday, 8th of May, and was only possible due to the kind support of our **sponsor Neos Biotec**! 
Thank you Neos Biotec for being with us 🥰. Also, thanks to all Iberian amig@s for coming and making this social event memorable!

The next Monday we went for a visit to the **silver building** of the British and Irish Chapter HQ at ISMRM 🏢, where we enjoyed some delicious street food and had great chats.

For the Iberian Chapter, ISMRM 2022 conference was a great opportunity to network with other ISMRM chapters and ISMRM members. Learning about the cutting-edge research that our MRI peers have been doing was extraordinary. We cannot leave ISMRM without being extra motivated to work on our own research!
