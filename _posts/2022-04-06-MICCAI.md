summary: "MICCAI 2022 Challenge: QuaD22, Quality augmentation in diffusion MRI for clinical studies"
---


The **Laboratorio de procesado de imagen from Universidad de Valladolid in Spain** is organizing a challenge for MICCAI conference 2022!

The task is to upgrade diffusion MRI data acquired with only 21 gradient directions to 61 gradient directions via DeepL.  
As a final result, the participants need to provide only three scalar metrics: FA, MD and AD.  
In order to compare the different methods, it will be used a real clinical study to statistically compare episodic migraine to chronic migraine. 
The Laboratorio de procesado de imagen have detected that differences between groups disappear when using 21 directions instead of 61. 

**Will any DL method be able to recover those differences?**
