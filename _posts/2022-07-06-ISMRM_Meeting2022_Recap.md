üìÖ **Day 1**  

We started the first day of the meeting with a welcome reception given by Dr. Rita Nunes, the Chair of the ISMRM Iberian Chapter.

The first plenary session of the meeting was in memory of Prof. Sebastian Cerd√°n ü§ç and was given by Pilar Lop√©z Larrubia (Madrid). This fascinating talk focused on an overview of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy techniques in the study of brain pathologies.

Bruker kindly sponsored a lunch session, where they highlighted their newest developments in the pre-clinical field. 

After the lunch break, we had an insightful oral session focused on clinical MRI. Speakers had the opportunity to share their work with the Iberian audience and discuss those matters in the Q&A moment. This session was followed by a power-pitch session and poster session, where in just 3 minutes our fantastic researchers presented their abstracts! ü§Ø

The final plenary session of the day was given by Miguel Castelo-Branco (Coimbra) covering a broad range of MR topics, focusing on translational pre-clinical and human studies including techniques such as spectroscopy or functional MRI.

At the end of the day, researchers found themselves in the streets of Lisbon, in a peddy-paper that led to some delicious ‚Äúginjinha‚Äù and the Iberian dinner.  

  

üìÖ **Day 2**  
On the second day, we started early with an amazing talk given by Luis Mart√≠-Bonmati (Valencia) that explored the several applications of artificial intelligence in clinical practice.

Next, we had a pre-clinical oral session, followed by a power-pitch session, similar to the one held during the first day but this time with a focus on clinical MRI, and the subsequent poster session.

Nuria Bargall√≥ (Barcelona) gave the last plenary talk on how Neuroimage techniques in patients with epilepsy are applied in the clinics
The final oral session was focused on Brain Imaging and covered clinical and pre-clinical research.

The day was finalized with a session on MR networks which consisted of a few presentations on academic networks available for researchers in all career stages. 

The second meeting of the chapter finished with some words given by Dr. Rita Nunes and awards were given to the best two talks and two posters. A musical moment provided by two chapter members closed the meeting in beauty.
