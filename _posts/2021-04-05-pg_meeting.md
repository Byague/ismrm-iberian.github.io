Hi, Olá and Hola all,

The annual Postgraduate (PG) Symposium of the British and Irish Chapter of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (BIC-ISMRM) will be organized for the first time ever in collaboration with the newly formed Iberian ISMRM Chapter!

After a year in which Brexit and the Pandemic dominated our agendas and threatened our desire to remain linked, isn’t this a Positive Spin around? What happens when a British, an Iberian and an Irish scientist logon to a virtual environment? Well, what a great experiment that would be... Let’s do it! This would be the perfect opportunity for PG students from all over the UK, Spain and Portugal to disseminate their work.

Together with our talented Event Planner Investigators (EPI) Team, our main mission is to ensure everybody gets the most out of the event. If there’s anything that we can learn from previous experiences is that online meetings come with [advantages](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02057-2?sf236038067=1), but with a massive lack of networking opportunities.. which is especially important for early career stages! To address this issue, a new buddy system will be introduced at this year’s meeting and we will give you the opportunity to share a brief introduction of yourself.

This year’s meeting will be held online on April 15th and 16th 2021 in the afternoon. The program includes traditional scientific talks and interactive poster sessions. In addition, we have planned two informal sessions aiming to inspire and support PG students on their future career choices.

We are looking forward to seeing you at the conference, we hope you'll be happy to (virtually) put yourself out there!
