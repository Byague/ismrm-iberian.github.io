Dear Iberian MRI Researchers,

On behalf of the ISMRM Iberian Chapter Committee, I am very happy to announce that our Second Annual Chapter Meeting will be held in June 27-28 of 2022 in Lisbon, Portugal. We are looking forward to welcoming you to our first ever face-to-face Scientific meeting!

We have already confirmed the presence of four excellent plenary speakers: Pilar López Larrubia from Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols, Madrid, Spain; Miguel Castelo Branco based at Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research, Portugal; Nuria Bargalló from Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain and Luis Martí- Bonmatí, Hospital Universitário y Politécnico La Fe from Valencia, Spain.

The meeting will also include oral and poster sessions where Chapter members will have the opportunity to present their work. As in the previous year, there will be awards for the best oral and poster presentations, so make sure you submit your abstract until the 23rd of May! 

The conference programme will also include time to explore this wonderful city and to network at our social events. I am looking forward to hosting you and I am certain that this presential meeting will lead to many fruitful discussions and future Iberian collaborations!
