Dear friends and colleagues,

On behalf of the ISMRM Iberian Chapter Committee, it is my pleasure to invite you all to our first Annual Chapter Meeting, to be held fully online on June 16-17, 2021.

This will be the first meeting organized by the newly formed ISMRM Iberian Chapter. The overall goal of the meeting is to provide a common venue for researchers and clinicians with Iberian connections across the spectrum of MR research.

Our program seeks to highlight the translational pipeline for MR research, including pre-clinical as well as clinical research, as performed by researchers around the globe. We will include plenary sessions by a diverse group of eminent researchers covering a wide range of imaging areas (stay tuned!), as well as additional oral and poster sessions. We will include awards for the best presentations in the pre-clinical and clinical categories (more details coming soon!).

There will also be plenty of chances for one-on-one discussions and informal networking. Specifically, there will be excellent opportunities for interaction between trainees and established researchers, as well as among trainees.

Finally, we would like to wholeheartedly thank the volunteers who have offered to help with the organization of this meeting. If you are interested in the activities of the ISMRM Iberian Chapter, let us know <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ISMRMIberian">@ISMRMIberian</a>!
We look forward to meeting old friends and making new friends at our First Annual Meeting!
