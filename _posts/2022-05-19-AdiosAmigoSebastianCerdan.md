It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to one of our founding members. Sebasti치n Cerd치n, passed away this weekend in Madrid, on May 14th 2022. 游밼

Sebasti치n worked at the forefront of biomedical applications of MR for over 40 years, carrying out his research in the United States (University of Pennsylvania, 1980-1984), Switzerland (University of Basel, 1986-1988), and Spain (Spanish National Research Council, 1989-2022). Among his most significant contributions, Sebasti치n pioneered the field of neuro-glial metabolic coupling using innovative heteronuclear NMR methods, and served as President of the ESMRMB (1996-2000; 2004-2010).

It was an honor having him as first keynote speaker of our very first annual meeting last year. A remarkable journey through his scientific career, with several take-home messages that we invite you to watch again (ISMRM link available soon).

Sebasti치n Cerd치n leaves an extensive and important legacy, with great scientists and technicians trained in numerous centers in Spain and other European countries.

Beyond his irrefutable impact as a scientist, Sebasti치n was a great friend, with a sharp sense of humor and always keen to help. A true gentleman and role model for so many of us following in his footsteps.

Farewell, beloved friend,

Pilar Lopez Larrubia & ISMRM Iberian Chapter Committee
